2
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:51,481
Come on, time to go.
We haven't got all day.

3
00:00:51,483 --> 00:00:55,519
Get that monkey on the train.

4
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:59,024
The Medici Brothers' circus
is taking off!

5
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,709
Breathing normal...

6
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:02,279
heart rate normal.

7
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:04,682
You're cleared to perform.

8
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,751
Milly!
Another train!

9
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:17,426
<i>Ninos,</i> wait!
We are coming, too!

10
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,507
Joplin!

11
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:33,308
Joplin, Missouri!

12
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,479
- Hey, sweetheart!
- Daddy!

13
00:04:06,711 --> 00:04:09,478
Oh, I meant to tell ya.

14
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,848
You know,
in the letter I sent?

15
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:15,452
I'm so sorry
that I wasn't here.

16
00:04:16,554 --> 00:04:17,822
Well, come here now.

17
00:04:18,923 --> 00:04:20,256
Still me.

18
00:04:27,464 --> 00:04:28,866
And you...

19
00:04:30,868 --> 00:04:32,335
you're just as pretty
as your momma.

20
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:42,312
We missed you, Dad.

21
00:04:43,814 --> 00:04:45,015
I missed you, too.

22
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:51,552
Ivan and Catherine,
thank you both...

23
00:04:51,554 --> 00:04:53,321
for looking out for them.

24
00:04:53,323 --> 00:04:54,789
Captain Farrier,
of course.

25
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,591
Oh, it's Holt, come on now.

26
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:57,926
It's just Holt.

27
00:04:57,928 --> 00:04:59,529
Don't you worry.

28
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:03,399
Everything's gonna be
just like it was before.

29
00:05:07,637 --> 00:05:08,636
Come on! Come on!

30
00:05:08,638 --> 00:05:10,005
Home sweet home.

31
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:12,308
- Hey! Holt!
- Hey, Puck.

32
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,642
- Hey, Thomas.
- Milly, come on!

33
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:15,845
Hi, Holt.

34
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,482
Oh! Hey, Miss Atlantis.

35
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,617
Pramesh!

36
00:05:22,619 --> 00:05:24,352
The very best journey,
dear friend.

37
00:05:24,354 --> 00:05:26,788
The road that leads home.

38
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,656
Welcome home.

39
00:05:30,593 --> 00:05:32,362
No hugs!

40
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,364
Pramesh,
I missed you, too.

41
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:39,534
What's going on? The camp's
half the size it used to be.

42
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:42,036
Hard times, my friend.
For everyone.

43
00:05:48,578 --> 00:05:50,812
Attention, everybody!

44
00:05:50,814 --> 00:05:54,749
Why is Rule Number One
called Rule Number One?

45
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:57,552
Because
"keep the cages locked"

46
00:05:57,554 --> 00:05:59,821
is the most important
rule of all!

47
00:05:59,823 --> 00:06:01,823
When I catch
that fugitive scalawag

48
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:03,524
who interrupted my dream...

49
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:04,492
Rongo!

50
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:05,827
Where is Rongo?

51
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:09,931
Who's heading
camp management?

52
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:11,165
I'm the strongman.

53
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:13,835
Yes, but we're all wearing
multiple hats!

54
00:06:13,837 --> 00:06:17,672
You're in charge of budgets,
and accounting, and inventory.

55
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:20,174
Which means
animal whereabouts!

56
00:06:20,176 --> 00:06:22,176
Now, go find that monkey!

57
00:06:22,178 --> 00:06:24,080
I'll have a look around.

58
00:06:31,054 --> 00:06:32,655
All right, everybody.
Back to work.

59
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,961
Holt!

60
00:06:48,104 --> 00:06:51,707
This winter, the influenza
hit us like a hurricane.

61
00:06:52,507 --> 00:06:55,176
Natalya, Vincenzo...

62
00:06:55,178 --> 00:06:57,814
the Vanderjees, and then...

63
00:06:59,015 --> 00:07:01,615
your wife.

64
00:07:01,617 --> 00:07:02,919
Poor Annie.

65
00:07:05,654 --> 00:07:07,656
How she fought.

66
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:11,961
She was the best of us.

67
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:15,029
I know it.

68
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:17,764
So, uh, you know, for her,

69
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:19,035
let's have
our best season yet!

70
00:07:20,602 --> 00:07:21,970
Now where's my horses?

71
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:24,205
Ah...

72
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:26,073
Funny story about that.

73
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:27,607
Funny how?

74
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:29,676
He sold them.

75
00:07:29,678 --> 00:07:31,478
But our act is the soul
of this show!

76
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,016
And first, we lost you,
and then Annie, to ride 'em!

77
00:07:36,018 --> 00:07:38,485
If only Milly would have
learned the trade.

78
00:07:38,487 --> 00:07:39,920
I don't wanna be a show-off
in your circus.

79
00:07:39,922 --> 00:07:42,055
- "Show-off"?
- You see?

80
00:07:42,057 --> 00:07:44,724
I wanna make
scientific discoveries.

81
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:46,526
I wanna be noticed
for my mind.

82
00:07:46,528 --> 00:07:47,994
Okay.

83
00:07:47,996 --> 00:07:51,631
Then learn clairvoyance.
Telepathy! Something!

84
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:54,668
I can do a handstand
for almost ten seconds.

85
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,070
Oh.

86
00:07:57,072 --> 00:08:01,074
"Child does handstand."
We'll be broke by July.

87
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:03,845
Hang on now. Without horses,
what the hell's my act?

88
00:08:04,846 --> 00:08:07,247
The crowds come to see me!

89
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:08,183
Max, please.

90
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:11,653
I need to work.

91
00:08:12,988 --> 00:08:14,721
Good news.

92
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:16,556
One job, I have.

93
00:08:16,558 --> 00:08:18,591
Okay, then.
Give me a showstopper.

94
00:08:18,593 --> 00:08:20,260
You know that old rascal
Itchy McPhee?

95
00:08:20,262 --> 00:08:21,962
He finally ran off
with the bearded lady.

96
00:08:21,964 --> 00:08:26,066
I've been filling in with
roustabouts ever since.

97
00:08:26,068 --> 00:08:28,201
I need somebody good
to tend the elephants.

98
00:08:28,203 --> 00:08:30,236
No, you're not serious.

99
00:08:30,238 --> 00:08:31,638
I am on occasion.

100
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,173
This is a big job
and you know it.

101
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:34,808
No, it's a big shovel
for a big pile of...

102
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:35,777
Dad.

103
00:08:38,313 --> 00:08:41,648
So you sold my horses
and kept your elephants.

104
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,918
Your scrawny, mangy,
cut-rate elephants.

105
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,155
They're important.
Especially this season.

106
00:08:47,923 --> 00:08:49,189
Why's that?

107
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:51,024
I know it goes
against my nature...

108
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:54,828
but for once,
I made an investment.

109
00:08:56,798 --> 00:09:00,033
<i>Bellissima!</i>
There she is!

110
00:09:00,035 --> 00:09:02,836
Our brand-new Asian female.

111
00:09:02,838 --> 00:09:05,804
I bought her off
a Brugelbecker in Biloxi.

112
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:07,806
I had to get him
way down on the price.

113
00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:09,575
But I swear to you, Holt,

114
00:09:09,577 --> 00:09:12,678
I saw something special
in her eyes.

115
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,016
This is your investment?
An old, sick elephant.

116
00:09:16,018 --> 00:09:18,120
Oh, no. She's not sick.

117
00:09:19,121 --> 00:09:20,753
Any day now...

118
00:09:20,755 --> 00:09:23,056
she's having a baby.

119
00:09:27,362 --> 00:09:30,130
Dad, watch! Dad!
I'm getting better!

120
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:31,832
Hang on now,
this is our tent?

121
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:34,367
What happened to our things?

122
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:37,772
We had nice furniture,
we had rooms.

123
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:41,107
Max, what didn't you sell?

124
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:43,042
You son of a gun.

125
00:09:43,044 --> 00:09:44,111
Dad, look!

126
00:09:44,812 --> 00:09:46,011
Toys?

127
00:09:46,013 --> 00:09:47,846
They're not toys.

128
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:49,315
They're for
my science experiments.

129
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:52,051
Well, we're a circus,
darlin', a circus.

130
00:09:52,053 --> 00:09:54,787
We need to be practical
if we want to survive.

131
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:57,357
You couldn't
just take up one act?

132
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:59,792
Tumblin' or tightrope?

133
00:09:59,794 --> 00:10:01,695
Maybe I don't need
the world staring at me.

134
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:04,730
Maybe I'm just not
you and Mom.

135
00:10:04,732 --> 00:10:06,033
Well, who makes the rules
in this family?

136
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:07,933
Mom did.

137
00:10:07,935 --> 00:10:09,134
Yeah, well,
I make them now.

138
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:11,236
So just, uh...
Go to your room!

139
00:10:11,238 --> 00:10:12,673
This is my room.

140
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:16,208
This is all our rooms.

141
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,310
See this?

142
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:20,112
You know what this is?

143
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:21,682
It's your inheritance.

144
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:25,350
Dad!

145
00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:28,787
Don't worry,
he's not going anywhere.

146
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:30,656
He's stuck here.

147
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:32,226
Like you and me.

148
00:10:46,006 --> 00:10:47,675
Come on, come on,
you're missing it!

149
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,145
Look, I can do it!
I'm doing it, Milly!

150
00:10:53,147 --> 00:10:55,013
A new season!

151
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:10,295
Let me in,
you little hairball!

152
00:11:18,072 --> 00:11:20,205
Hey!

153
00:11:20,207 --> 00:11:23,743
Would somebody please
let me in my own train?

154
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:08,219
Dad, wake up! Let's go!

155
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:09,488
The elephants need us!

156
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,955
Good God, son,

157
00:12:10,957 --> 00:12:12,424
you're gonna make me
miss the war.

158
00:12:12,426 --> 00:12:14,759
Gimme that.

159
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:16,060
Go on, lead the way.

160
00:12:16,062 --> 00:12:17,931
Move it!

161
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:22,099
Let's skedaddle, Mrs. Jumbo!

162
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:24,001
Don't make me
have to incentivize.

163
00:12:24,003 --> 00:12:25,002
Get her out of there, boys.

164
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:28,906
Easy, Rufus.

165
00:12:28,908 --> 00:12:30,475
That's a lady in there.

166
00:12:30,477 --> 00:12:33,110
Well, well, our own Tom Mix
ridin' in to the rescue.

167
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:35,346
But he just ain't
on the marquee no more.

168
00:12:35,348 --> 00:12:37,081
Time to see
what he's been missing.

169
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,783
Do you ever
get that feeling?

170
00:12:38,785 --> 00:12:40,218
Like there's something
you're missing?

171
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,453
Imagine my surprise,
you didn't enlist.

172
00:12:42,455 --> 00:12:45,122
- Weak ticker. Doc's advice.
- Uh-huh.

173
00:12:45,124 --> 00:12:48,025
Dad? Something's wrong.

174
00:12:48,027 --> 00:12:50,363
She doesn't wanna leave.

175
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:55,366
Come on!

176
00:12:55,368 --> 00:12:56,936
Let's get her outta there!

177
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,774
- What are you doing?
- Come on!

178
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:04,475
Leave her alone!

179
00:13:04,477 --> 00:13:06,077
- Stop hurting her, please!
- Leave her alone!

180
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:19,156
Dad, look.

181
00:13:19,158 --> 00:13:20,460
What now?

182
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:22,861
Move her!

183
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:28,898
Whoa, we got
a baby in here.

184
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:35,606
She had a baby!

185
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:36,873
- Baby!
- Huh?

186
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,042
Notify the press!

187
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:39,310

00:13:45,351 --> 00:13:46,486
Look at that.

191
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:49,054
It's okay now.

192
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:52,292
Don't be scared.

193
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,364
Don't be scared now,
your momma's right outside.

194
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:31,361
Baby! We got a baby!

195
00:14:31,363 --> 00:14:32,964
We got a baby!

196
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:39,637
What is that?

197
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,939
Baby Jumbo.

198
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,241
I already got fake freaks
in the freak show!

199
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:47,477
I don't need a real one
in the center ring!

200
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:50,447
Rongo!
We've been swindled!

201
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:53,416
Gone and
bought yourself a baby monster.

202
00:14:53,418 --> 00:14:54,453
Think he can hear me?

203
00:14:56,221 --> 00:14:57,487
Boo!

204
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:18,208
Rongo!

We are not advertising

Tell me you didn't do it.

211
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:36,192
You did it?

with me first!

Why me? Why me?

215
00:15:47,672 --> 00:15:49,972
A face
only a mother could love.

216
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:51,141
Sir?

217
00:15:51,143 --> 00:15:53,443
Many of us
find you handsome.

218
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:55,280
I was talking
about the elephant!

219
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:02,587
Look, she's drawing him
a bath.

220
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,326
Need a vet to come
to look at him, Max.

221
00:16:10,328 --> 00:16:12,127
No, no witnesses!

222
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:14,029
We are going to be in Joplin
for two weeks.

223
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:15,632
We promised them
a beautiful baby!

224
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:18,100
You have until tomorrow
night to fix that!

225
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,636
- Me?
- Yes, you!

226
00:16:19,638 --> 00:16:21,003
This is my problem?

227
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:22,305
Yes.
You tend the elephants.

228
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:24,175
Make those ears disappear!

229
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:33,984
Don't look at me.

230
00:16:42,694 --> 00:16:44,529
Look at him, those
giant ears weigh him down.

231
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:49,599
Hi, Baby Jumbo.

232
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:51,467
Welcome to the circus.

233
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,405
We're all family here.
No matter how small.

234
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,040
Aren't elephants
afraid of mice?

235
00:16:58,042 --> 00:17:01,343
Says who?
That's why we experiment.

236
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:02,544
Someone needs to
keep him company.

237
00:17:02,546 --> 00:17:03,748
when he's not with his momma.

238
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:17,326
Look. Give him one.

239
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:21,497
If he can lift his ears
out of the way.

240
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,665
No. You have to blow
your ears out of the way.

241
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,536
Like this.

242
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:31,139
Good luck with that.

243
00:17:31,141 --> 00:17:33,175
Maybe you can teach him
to juggle, too.

244
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,776
Baby Jumbo, look at me.

245
00:17:34,778 --> 00:17:36,111
Do what I do.

246
00:17:36,113 --> 00:17:37,348
Blow.

247
00:17:44,788 --> 00:17:48,156
No, not the feather.
Your ears. Blow!

248
00:17:48,158 --> 00:17:50,127
He thinks it's a game.

249
00:17:51,428 --> 00:17:53,195
- Oh, Max, come here.
- What?

250
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,130
Watch this.

251
00:17:55,132 --> 00:17:58,300
I ride out, I do some jumps,
then all of a sudden...

252
00:17:58,302 --> 00:18:00,302
stampede!

253
00:18:00,304 --> 00:18:01,370
Send 'em!

254
00:18:03,173 --> 00:18:04,375
Get out of the way, Max!

255
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:09,747
I'm, uh, still working out
the timing.

256
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,354
Let me have a turn.

257
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:33,468
Meanwhile, for when you

258
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,670
- lead out the elephants...
- Uh-huh.

259
00:18:34,672 --> 00:18:35,771
I had the
costume departments

260
00:18:35,773 --> 00:18:36,872
make you up
a little something.

261
00:18:36,874 --> 00:18:37,775
Okay.

262
00:18:39,476 --> 00:18:40,809
What in gosh...

263
00:18:40,811 --> 00:18:42,778
You really broke the bank
with this, Max.

264
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,412
A lot of kids
come to the show.

265
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,213
You don't want me to
scare anyone, I get it.

266
00:18:46,215 --> 00:18:47,348
Dad, Dad!

267
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,750
It's Baby Jumbo.
Come see.

268
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,719
He jumped in the air.
With his ears.

269
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:52,386
Guys,
I said leave him be.

270
00:18:52,388 --> 00:18:53,522
But he was this
far off the ground!

271
00:18:53,524 --> 00:18:54,856
Yeah, I bet he was.

272
00:18:54,858 --> 00:18:56,725
He'll be tripping all over
with ears like that.

273
00:18:56,727 --> 00:18:58,627
Dad, really.
We tried an experiment.

274
00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:00,330
Just leave the poor guy alone.

275
00:19:04,668 --> 00:19:07,568
First rule of science,
you have to have interest.

276
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,873
Otherwise,
you don't deserve to know.

277
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:15,176
It's been a rough year
for both of them.

278
00:19:15,178 --> 00:19:16,780
Annie knew
how to talk to 'em.

279

280

00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:27,421

283
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:37,598

I am

And now, I give to you...

298
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,977
the Medici Brothers' circus.

299
00:21:05,454 --> 00:21:06,687
Okay.

300
00:21:06,689 --> 00:21:08,488
Okay, okay,
no one's gonna hurt him.

301
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:11,259
Okay, little guy,
let's put on a show.

302
00:21:37,652 --> 00:21:41,521
Hey, ain't that Holt Farrier,
the Stallion Star?

303
00:21:41,523 --> 00:21:44,925
Hey!
Ain't you Holt Farrier?

304
00:21:44,927 --> 00:21:47,429
Nah, he died
in the war. So sad.

305
00:21:52,634 --> 00:21:54,336
Aw!

306
00:21:56,738 --> 00:21:58,707
Aw!

307
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,712
What's he doing?

308
00:22:10,418 --> 00:22:12,354
He's reaching
for the feathers.

309
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:22,664
Coat, coat, coat, coat!

310
00:22:39,114 --> 00:22:40,814
Ooh...

311
00:22:40,816 --> 00:22:43,483
What'd you do to that thing?
That ain't a real elephant.

312
00:22:43,485 --> 00:22:45,051
Those ears are fake!

313
00:22:45,053 --> 00:22:46,953
Look! Look at the sign!

314
00:22:46,955 --> 00:22:48,757
"Dumbo!"

315
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,896
Uh-oh.

316
00:22:56,898 --> 00:22:59,065
Whoa, calm down, now.

317
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,871
He's a fake!

318
00:23:04,873 --> 00:23:06,139
Yeah, he's a fake!

319
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:07,807
Shut up!

320
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:08,944
You're scaring the elephants!

321
00:23:10,946 --> 00:23:12,745
Take it easy now.
Calm down.

322
00:23:12,747 --> 00:23:14,747
Dumbo,
Dumbo, fake, fake, fake!

323
00:23:16,718 --> 00:23:18,117
All right, sit down.

324
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:18,885
Dumbo, Dumbo,
fake, fake, fake!

325
00:23:18,887 --> 00:23:19,921
I said sit down!

326
00:23:20,956 --> 00:23:22,090
It's okay, little fella.

327
00:23:23,825 --> 00:23:24,926
Fake!

328
00:23:26,795 --> 00:23:28,660
Rongo! Music!

329
00:23:28,662 --> 00:23:30,763
Happiness, joy!

330
00:23:38,173 --> 00:23:41,740
Hear 'em making
fun of your ugly baby?

331
00:23:41,742 --> 00:23:43,644
Who's gonna help him now?

332
00:23:45,947 --> 00:23:49,448
Holt, get those ears
off the stage!

333
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,554
Whoa!

334
00:23:58,126 --> 00:24:00,059
Okay, all right.

335
00:24:00,061 --> 00:24:01,460
Okay, nobody's gonna
hurt your baby.

336
00:24:01,462 --> 00:24:03,564
Just calm down.

337
00:24:04,165 --> 00:24:06,531
Okay. Attagirl.

338
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:08,402
We're here to protect him.
Same as you.

339
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,670
Attagirl.

340
00:24:11,672 --> 00:24:12,871
Nice and easy.

341
00:24:17,011 --> 00:24:18,879
Shh. Okay, nobody's gonna
hurt your baby.

342
00:24:21,048 --> 00:24:22,583
Rufus, no!

343
00:24:24,252 --> 00:24:26,051
- Rufus, stop!
- Mad elephant!

344
00:24:26,053 --> 00:24:27,119
Get back!

345
00:24:33,527 --> 00:24:35,160
Max, get the kids out of here!

346
00:24:35,162 --> 00:24:37,029
Everybody, out!
Get to safety.

347
00:24:37,031 --> 00:24:38,565
Careful, careful.

348
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:47,005
Kids?

349
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:48,540
Go, go, go!

350
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:49,641
Quick, quick, quick.
Go, go, go.

351
00:24:49,643 --> 00:24:50,678
Come on. This way, come on.

352
00:24:52,246 --> 00:24:55,049
How do you like your job now,
cowboy?

353
00:24:57,851 --> 00:24:58,719
Uh-oh.

354
00:25:02,723 --> 00:25:04,558
Milly, Joe! Come on!

355
00:25:06,293 --> 00:25:07,761
Let's go!
Come on!

356
00:25:41,561 --> 00:25:42,894
And I wanna
just emphasize,

357
00:25:42,896 --> 00:25:44,562
we did everything right.

358
00:25:44,564 --> 00:25:46,564
What it is, the tent
just absolutely fell down.

359
00:25:46,566 --> 00:25:47,966
It just collapsed.

360
00:25:47,968 --> 00:25:49,870
And we had no way of knowing
what was gonna happen.

361
00:27:56,863 --> 00:27:59,430
Brugelbecker,
I have a man dead,

362
00:27:59,432 --> 00:28:00,797
do you understand?

363
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,433
This is what they're reading

364
00:28:02,435 --> 00:28:04,001
from the Great Lakes
to the Gulf!

365
00:28:04,003 --> 00:28:06,070
You have
a moral responsibility

366
00:28:06,072 --> 00:28:08,072
to buy
your killer elephant back.

367
00:28:08,074 --> 00:28:10,241
What about the baby?

368
00:28:10,243 --> 00:28:13,310
Well, at least
he got a few laughs.

369
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:14,911
I'll put him
in the clown act,

370
00:28:14,913 --> 00:28:17,083
see if I can
salvage something.

371
00:28:19,252 --> 00:28:20,919
I'll buy her back half price.

372
00:28:22,488 --> 00:28:25,156
You will buy her back
full price.

373
00:28:25,158 --> 00:28:26,390
Quarter price.

374
00:28:26,392 --> 00:28:28,925
Half price it is!

375
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,700
Up!

376
00:28:39,037 --> 00:28:40,870
What's happening?
Where are they taking her?

377
00:28:40,872 --> 00:28:42,071
Away.
Back to your tent now.

378
00:28:42,073 --> 00:28:43,873
But she's his mom!

379
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,842
Dad, please.
Stop them.

380
00:28:45,844 --> 00:28:47,110
Please!

381
00:28:47,112 --> 00:28:48,512
Do something.

382
00:28:48,514 --> 00:28:50,182
Mom would have
done something.

383
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:52,717
Momma's not here.

384
00:28:57,789 --> 00:29:01,157
Okay, little fella.
Okay. Come on.

385
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:06,029
I know, I do.

386
00:29:06,031 --> 00:29:10,266
Beautiful creature,
we'll take care of your son.

387
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:33,218
Darlin', it's late.

388
00:30:34,452 --> 00:30:36,086
Go on now.

389
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:33,008
I know.
I can't sleep, either.

390
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:35,377
My momma told me
there'd be times

391
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:39,548
when my life seemed
locked behind a door.

392
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:45,954
So, she gave me this key,
that her momma gave her.

393
00:31:45,956 --> 00:31:49,458
And said
whenever I have that feeling,

394
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,526
imagine that door...

395
00:31:51,528 --> 00:31:52,629
and just turn the key.

396
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:57,501
So, I keep trying.

397
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:07,709
Not supposed to
be in here alone.

398
00:32:07,711 --> 00:32:09,678
I'm not. You're here.

399
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,246
What's that?

400
00:32:11,248 --> 00:32:13,715
I just thought
he might be hungry.

401
00:32:13,717 --> 00:32:15,319
He's sad.

402
00:32:16,487 --> 00:32:18,019
You don't eat
when you're sad.

403
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:19,356
The mermaid does.

404
00:32:21,258 --> 00:32:23,058
Come on.

405
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,494
Have one, Dumbo.

406
00:32:25,496 --> 00:32:27,496
We're calling him Dumbo now?

407
00:32:27,498 --> 00:32:29,631
If we call him
Jumbo Junior...

408
00:32:29,633 --> 00:32:32,202
it might make him
miss his mom.

409
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:41,610
Here you go... Dumbo.

410
00:32:41,612 --> 00:32:44,413
Come on,
and flap those ears again.

411
00:32:44,415 --> 00:32:46,517
To show us
we didn't imagine it.

412
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:54,190
Your momma, she didn't
mean to hurt anyone.

413
00:32:55,191 --> 00:32:57,325
She was just protecting you.

414
00:32:57,327 --> 00:32:59,962
And we think
your ears are great.

415
00:33:04,601 --> 00:33:07,569
Maybe he wants to be alone.
Like Dad.

416
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:09,573
Nobody wants to be alone.

417
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:11,508
Well...

418
00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:15,111
if you change your mind...

419
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:19,650
Night-night, Dumbo.

420
00:33:49,545 --> 00:33:50,513
Wow!

421
00:33:54,584 --> 00:33:56,717
It's not the peanuts
that made him do it.

422
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:58,087
It's the feathers!

423
00:34:05,061 --> 00:34:06,229
Dumbo!

424
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:38,726
Dumbo, you gotta do this
in the show.

425
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:40,427
What do you mean?

426
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:41,795
'Cause if the circus
sells more tickets

427
00:34:41,797 --> 00:34:43,230
and Medici makes
more money...

428
00:34:43,232 --> 00:34:44,398
then we can get him
to use some

429
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,399
to buy Mrs. Jumbo back.

430
00:34:45,401 --> 00:34:46,567
Yeah!

431
00:34:46,569 --> 00:34:49,135
We can get her back, Dumbo.
You can.

432
00:34:49,137 --> 00:34:50,838
Just show them all
what you can do.

433
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,439
Come on.
We gotta tell Dad.

434
00:34:52,441 --> 00:34:55,309
No. He'll just tell us
to be practical.

435
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:57,278
Shows got canceled
for a week, right?

436
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,315
We can research
and study and test.

437
00:35:00,883 --> 00:35:04,150
You're a miracle elephant,
Dumbo.

438
00:35:04,152 --> 00:35:06,289
And we're gonna
bring your momma home.

439
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:11,124
Fire!

440
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:33,714
So low.

441
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:35,381
An all-time low.

442
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,317
Who said he didn't want
to be recognized?

443
00:35:39,154 --> 00:35:42,522
Okay, Big D, this is it.
Just like in rehearsal.

444
00:35:42,524 --> 00:35:44,557
Except for lights, music,
fire and crowds.

445
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,428
- You can do it.
- Come on, Dumbo.

446
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,630
You can do it, Dumbo!

447
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,764
Show 'em all
like you showed us!

448
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,905
- Come! Come! Come!
- Attaboy, come on.

449
00:35:57,907 --> 00:35:59,873
Keep comin'. Come on.

450
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,716
Go on now, Dumbo!
Come on.

451
00:36:09,718 --> 00:36:11,250
Whoa.

452
00:36:15,724 --> 00:36:17,523
Hey! Hey!

453
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:41,549
They love it! They love it!

454
00:36:45,387 --> 00:36:46,519
All right, Dumbo.

455
00:36:46,521 --> 00:36:47,722
You put out the fire.

456
00:37:05,907 --> 00:37:07,573
He won't fly.
He's scared.

457
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:09,409
I know.
Now, he's up too high.

458
00:37:16,551 --> 00:37:17,552
Go on, Dumbo!

459
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:33,768
Attaboy.

460
00:37:36,336 --> 00:37:38,538
Yeah!
Rule Number One.

461
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,307
"Always have a big finish!"

462
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:45,477
Aw!

463
00:37:49,383 --> 00:37:51,485
Okay, guys.
Bring him down.

464
00:37:52,754 --> 00:37:53,755
Yeah!

465
00:38:04,531 --> 00:38:06,866
Holt!

466
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,500
- Look, Max!
- What? What?

467
00:38:08,502 --> 00:38:10,270
- He's trapped up there.
- Put the fire out!

468
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,006
Dumbo! Fly!

469
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:16,443
He won't fly
without a feather!

470
00:38:20,414 --> 00:38:22,481
Put the fire out!

471
00:38:22,483 --> 00:38:23,584
Put it out!

472
00:38:24,953 --> 00:38:26,651
- Joe!
- Stop!

473
00:38:28,022 --> 00:38:30,758
Holt, I thought she didn't
want to be in an act.

474
00:38:33,861 --> 00:38:34,828
Milly!

475
00:38:51,779 --> 00:38:53,445
Here, Dumbo!

476
00:38:53,447 --> 00:38:54,948
Come on.

477
00:38:55,649 --> 00:38:56,683
Show 'em.

478
00:38:58,452 --> 00:38:59,720
Come on, Dumbo.

479
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:27,979
Fly, Dumbo.

480
00:39:27,981 --> 00:39:28,916
Fly!

481
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:42,596
Whoa!

482
00:39:45,799 --> 00:39:46,967
Yeah!

483
00:40:22,468 --> 00:40:24,169
You knew
he could do this?

484
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:26,472
You should talk
to your kids more.

485
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,216
Sotheby...

486
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:40,451
cancel my dinner
with the president.

487
00:40:40,453 --> 00:40:42,722
We've got business
with an elephant.

488
00:40:45,658 --> 00:40:47,491
Friends,

489
00:40:47,493 --> 00:40:50,761
the next available shows
are in Arkansas!

490
00:40:51,797 --> 00:40:53,064
<i>♪ Happy clowns!</i>

491
00:40:57,637 --> 00:41:01,139
- Ah, Rongo the Strong!
- Boss.

492
00:41:01,141 --> 00:41:02,673
Hello, Jo!

493
00:41:02,675 --> 00:41:05,042
The Medici Brothers' circus.

494
00:41:05,044 --> 00:41:08,981
Where true love
and mystery abound!

495
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,049
Now where's my star?

496
00:41:12,051 --> 00:41:15,185
Ah, Dumbo!

497
00:41:15,187 --> 00:41:16,520
How's your bath?

498
00:41:16,522 --> 00:41:18,555
Too warm? Too cold?

499
00:41:18,557 --> 00:41:21,759
Ladies, make sure his wrinkles
don't get wrinkles.

500
00:41:21,761 --> 00:41:24,161
In our country,
legend tells us

501
00:41:24,163 --> 00:41:26,931
the gods can
take animal forms.

502
00:41:26,933 --> 00:41:28,699
Champagne for Dumbo!

503
00:41:28,701 --> 00:41:30,770
No booze near the baby!

504
00:41:52,825 --> 00:41:53,993
Sorry, Dumbo.

505
00:41:55,261 --> 00:41:56,660
It's not your momma.

506
00:41:56,662 --> 00:41:58,297
Take Dumbo back inside.

507
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:10,140
Ladies and gentlemen,
please make way

508
00:42:10,142 --> 00:42:11,909
for the emperor
of enchantment.

509
00:42:11,911 --> 00:42:13,243
For the architect of dreams.

510
00:42:13,245 --> 00:42:15,578
For the Columbus
of Coney Island.

511
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,547
Mr. V.A. Vandevere!

512
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,022
And traveling with him,
his bright shining star.

513
00:42:25,024 --> 00:42:28,591
Colette Marchant,
the Queen of the Heavens!

514
00:42:28,593 --> 00:42:30,127
Miss Marchant!
Miss Marchant!

515
00:42:33,631 --> 00:42:34,699
Ah.

516
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:37,036
<i>Signore</i> Medici!

517
00:42:37,903 --> 00:42:39,569
He knows who I am.

518
00:42:39,571 --> 00:42:41,105
We were just
passing through Missouri...

519
00:42:41,107 --> 00:42:43,140
and we heard you were
putting on a little show.

520
00:42:43,142 --> 00:42:46,843
Mr. Vandevere.
It's an honor.

521
00:42:46,845 --> 00:42:49,814
No, sir.
The honor is mine.

522
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:53,883
I would like
to offer you a drink.

523
00:42:53,885 --> 00:42:56,220
But I'm all out of bourbon.

524
00:42:58,157 --> 00:43:00,590
And cognac and scotch.

525
00:43:06,765 --> 00:43:09,166
Not now!

526
00:43:10,635 --> 00:43:12,204
Is that a monkey
in your desk?

527
00:43:13,172 --> 00:43:14,704
Just for emergencies.

528
00:43:14,706 --> 00:43:17,006
Look, Mr. Vandevere...

529
00:43:17,008 --> 00:43:18,775
I probably should tell you...

530
00:43:18,777 --> 00:43:21,177
the elephant is not for sale.

531
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:23,813
Dumbo will only fly
for the Medici circus.

532
00:43:23,815 --> 00:43:26,151
That's assuming he is real.

533
00:43:33,258 --> 00:43:34,757
See for yourself.

534
00:43:34,759 --> 00:43:37,126
And all due respect,
I don't got all day.

535
00:43:37,128 --> 00:43:38,696
- Pleasure to meet you...
- Excuse me.

536
00:43:39,864 --> 00:43:40,899
Hello there.

537
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,107
So this, uh,
creature of yours...

538
00:43:51,109 --> 00:43:52,844
is supposed to fly?

539
00:43:54,279 --> 00:43:55,878
Trade secrets.

540
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:00,685
Ugh.

541
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:08,658
Uh, Max,
if you don't mind my asking...

542
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:13,129
where did you
come upon the animal?

543
00:44:13,131 --> 00:44:15,298
He hails
from the far east.

544
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,732
How far?

545
00:44:16,734 --> 00:44:18,134
Far.

546
00:44:18,136 --> 00:44:21,104
He doesn't look
like "magic" to me.

547
00:44:21,106 --> 00:44:23,806
Well, what the heck can you
tell by appearances, right?

548
00:44:23,808 --> 00:44:26,809
And you train
flying elephants, too?

549
00:44:26,811 --> 00:44:28,279
Yeah, it's a little hobby
on the side.

550
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:33,151
It's the kids taught Dumbo.

551
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:37,754
Ah, yes.

552
00:44:41,226 --> 00:44:42,391
Yeah?

553
00:44:42,393 --> 00:44:46,028
And how on earth
did you do that?

554
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,430
With the
scientific method.

555
00:44:49,367 --> 00:44:51,766
One picture, one picture!

556
00:44:51,768 --> 00:44:53,469
Max.

557
00:44:53,471 --> 00:44:56,272
You possess something
that's very rare in life.

558
00:44:56,274 --> 00:44:58,974
And the tragedy of it is,

559
00:44:58,976 --> 00:45:01,877
is you don't even know
that you have it.

560
00:45:01,879 --> 00:45:04,480
Do you know what it is
that you have, Max?

561
00:45:04,482 --> 00:45:05,747
No.

562
00:45:05,749 --> 00:45:07,050
It's mystique.

563
00:45:08,286 --> 00:45:10,986
Max, I know your type.

564
00:45:10,988 --> 00:45:13,356
Charlatan, con man,
opportunist...

565
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:16,425
New York is that way,
in case you need directions.

566
00:45:16,427 --> 00:45:18,994
And I know it comes
from a deep desire

567
00:45:18,996 --> 00:45:20,929
to build something
authentic and true.

568
00:45:20,931 --> 00:45:22,764
I know your game.

569
00:45:22,766 --> 00:45:24,099
It's not a game.

570
00:45:24,101 --> 00:45:27,405
Some men cheat the rules,
others change them.

571
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:29,940
It's up your sleeve.

572
00:45:31,141 --> 00:45:33,010
It's in your pocket.

573
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,816
The secret
to show business

574
00:45:41,818 --> 00:45:43,386
is always keep a rabbit
in your hat.

575
00:45:43,388 --> 00:45:46,023
Or a monkey in your desk,
I guess.

576
00:45:47,758 --> 00:45:49,157
Ownership shares?

577
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:50,426
Max, look around you.

578
00:45:50,428 --> 00:45:52,861
Your entire way of life
is dying.

579
00:45:52,863 --> 00:45:54,429
The future of the
entertainment business

580
00:45:54,431 --> 00:45:56,264
is to bring
the audience to you.

581
00:45:56,266 --> 00:45:58,200
And I've built
that destination.

582
00:45:58,202 --> 00:46:00,835
What I'm lacking...

583
00:46:00,837 --> 00:46:02,973
is a protege.

584
00:46:06,043 --> 00:46:09,146
I know
there's no Medici Brothers.

585
00:46:10,347 --> 00:46:13,217
You probably always
wanted one.

586
00:46:14,418 --> 00:46:16,017
You're offering me
a partnership?

587
00:46:16,019 --> 00:46:17,185
Yes.

588
00:46:17,187 --> 00:46:19,020
And a home.

589
00:46:19,022 --> 00:46:21,022
For you
and the entire troupe.

590
00:46:21,024 --> 00:46:24,125
A home?
For all of us?

591
00:46:24,127 --> 00:46:26,461
Yes. Join me.

592
00:46:26,463 --> 00:46:28,563
Join me and my family.

593
00:46:28,565 --> 00:46:31,333
Let me take us all
into the future.

594
00:46:31,335 --> 00:46:33,337
Let me take us all...

595
00:46:34,471 --> 00:46:36,306
to Dreamland!

596
00:47:19,249 --> 00:47:22,016
I wish Momma
could've seen this.

597
00:47:22,018 --> 00:47:24,288
Well, somehow,
I think she knows we're here.

598
00:47:29,959 --> 00:47:32,061
Way to work your magic, Max.

599
00:47:42,572 --> 00:47:45,172
We hear you, Dumbo!

600
00:47:45,174 --> 00:47:46,641
Why won't you
let him see outside?

601
00:47:46,643 --> 00:47:49,109
Remember, young lady...

602
00:47:49,111 --> 00:47:50,313
mystique.

603
00:47:54,518 --> 00:47:56,852
Now this is why
I joined the circus.

604
00:48:00,423 --> 00:48:03,123
Dad.
Wonders of Science!

605
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:04,391
All right, sugar plum.

606
00:48:04,393 --> 00:48:06,193
Remember, we got
a job to do here.

607
00:48:06,195 --> 00:48:08,929
My daughter, she fancies
herself the next Marie Curie.

608
00:48:08,931 --> 00:48:12,634
Don't ever let anybody
tell you what you can't do.

609
00:48:12,636 --> 00:48:15,402
Hang on,
I wasn't saying she can't.

610
00:48:15,404 --> 00:48:19,940
What is it exactly that
we do here, <i>ma cherie?</i>

611
00:48:19,942 --> 00:48:23,479
We make
the impossible possible.

612
00:48:28,551 --> 00:48:30,150
And that's where
you'll perform.

613
00:48:30,152 --> 00:48:31,452
The Colosseum!

614
00:48:31,454 --> 00:48:34,421
Dumbo will stay
in the training tent behind.

615
00:48:34,423 --> 00:48:35,522
Dumbo!

616
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:42,596
Why aren't we
going with him?

617
00:48:42,598 --> 00:48:46,469
Because that
is your new home.

618
00:48:52,108 --> 00:48:53,142
Wow!

619
00:48:54,343 --> 00:48:56,176
Look at this place!

620
00:48:56,178 --> 00:48:57,544
A library...

621
00:48:57,546 --> 00:48:59,580
"And the children
shall lead them."

622
00:48:59,582 --> 00:49:01,615
We're grateful for the
opportunity, Mr. Vandevere.

623
00:49:01,617 --> 00:49:04,651
Oh, your family's mine.

624
00:49:07,056 --> 00:49:10,691
You know, I've been brushing
up on your story, Mr. Farrier.

625
00:49:10,693 --> 00:49:12,992
Kentucky's top trick rider.

626
00:49:12,994 --> 00:49:14,395
Well, there's no reason
you can't be again...

627
00:49:14,397 --> 00:49:17,564
only here,
you'd be Captain Farrier...

628
00:49:17,566 --> 00:49:18,699
war hero.

629
00:49:21,437 --> 00:49:22,503
One-armed wonder.

630
00:49:22,505 --> 00:49:24,038
National treasure.

631
00:49:24,673 --> 00:49:26,139
Wow!

632
00:49:26,141 --> 00:49:27,408
Well, I still can ride.

633
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:28,609
Oh, I know you can.

634
00:49:28,611 --> 00:49:31,077
And you're going to.

635
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:32,513
Right after you get
that little elephant

636
00:49:32,515 --> 00:49:33,747
off the ground for me.

637
00:49:33,749 --> 00:49:35,549
You mean
once his act's working?

638
00:49:35,551 --> 00:49:37,317
You're back in the saddle.

639
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:39,319
We're still working
on the schedule

640
00:49:39,321 --> 00:49:40,454
for the rest
of your troupe...

641
00:49:40,456 --> 00:49:42,489
but on Friday...

642
00:49:42,491 --> 00:49:44,225
we premiere
our little Dumbo.

643
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:48,664
I get goose bumps.

644
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:53,434
Why are you
looking at me?

645
00:49:53,436 --> 00:49:55,301
Well, because
the only thing

646
00:49:55,303 --> 00:49:58,405
more amazing
than a flying elephant...

647
00:49:58,407 --> 00:49:59,941
is the goddess
who can fly it.

648
00:50:01,544 --> 00:50:03,610
Have you lost your mind?

649
00:50:06,482 --> 00:50:09,518
Let's not forget from
whence we came, darling.

650
00:50:11,587 --> 00:50:13,587
So, we fly Friday!

651
00:50:13,589 --> 00:50:17,724
Uh, Dumbo's never flown
with anyone.

652
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:20,694
That's why it's become
abundantly clear

653
00:50:20,696 --> 00:50:21,697
why we need you.

654
00:50:24,032 --> 00:50:25,364
Dumbo!

655
00:50:29,504 --> 00:50:31,504
Hey, buddy. We missed you.
You all right?

656
00:50:31,506 --> 00:50:34,307
Hey. Captain Farrier
is in charge.

657
00:50:34,309 --> 00:50:36,244
No one sees the animal
without his approval.

658
00:50:36,678 --> 00:50:37,710
Holt.

659
00:50:37,712 --> 00:50:39,247
Just call me Holt.

660
00:50:40,582 --> 00:50:42,582
I thought you were
a military man.

661
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:45,051
Nice boots you bagged there.
What are they, shark skin?

662
00:50:45,053 --> 00:50:48,054
No.

663
00:50:48,056 --> 00:50:49,322
So you better keep
your elephant friend

664
00:50:49,324 --> 00:50:50,658
on my good side.

665
00:50:56,164 --> 00:50:57,131
Hiya, Dumbo.

666
00:51:04,305 --> 00:51:06,339
Dumbo, you mind?

667
00:51:06,341 --> 00:51:07,442
Can I get my arm?

668
00:51:09,244 --> 00:51:11,145
And these are the hands
I'll be putting my life in?

669
00:51:11,713 --> 00:51:13,613
Welcome.

670
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:16,215
For the record,
this was not my idea.

671
00:51:16,217 --> 00:51:17,683
Dumbo works alone.

672
00:51:17,685 --> 00:51:19,287
So do I.

673
00:51:21,322 --> 00:51:22,524
<i>Bonjour,</i> Milly, Joe...

674
00:51:24,192 --> 00:51:25,791
And you...

675
00:51:28,863 --> 00:51:30,429
Hmm, charming.

676
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,697
Well, maybe he doesn't
recognize you

677
00:51:31,699 --> 00:51:34,233
without your makeup.

678
00:51:34,235 --> 00:51:36,101
So I gotta
teach you to fly?

679
00:51:36,103 --> 00:51:40,439
I know how to fly,
ever since I was a child.

680
00:51:40,441 --> 00:51:42,742
They taught
Dumbo to fly, no?

681
00:51:42,744 --> 00:51:44,479
So I don't need
your expertise.

682
00:51:46,281 --> 00:51:48,581
All right.

683
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:51,216
Well, just so you know,
I've been to France.

684
00:51:51,218 --> 00:51:52,785
It wasn't a good experience.

685
00:51:52,787 --> 00:51:54,754
Show me your secret!

686
00:51:54,756 --> 00:51:56,789
How on earth
does your elephant fly?

687
00:51:56,791 --> 00:51:59,192
Well, first,
he needs a feather.

688
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,062
He won't fly
without a feather.

689
00:52:03,263 --> 00:52:06,331
Well then,
neither will I.

690
00:52:34,161 --> 00:52:35,828
Whoa, slow down, princess.
Safety first.

691
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:37,162
Guys, nets.

692
00:52:37,164 --> 00:52:38,332
Come on, hurry.

693
00:52:41,501 --> 00:52:43,236
All right, guys, good.

694
00:52:52,212 --> 00:52:53,680
See, Dumbo?

695
00:52:54,849 --> 00:52:56,884
I fly!

696
00:53:05,425 --> 00:53:07,127
See if you can catch me!

697
00:53:09,964 --> 00:53:11,463
Here, Dumbo!

698
00:54:11,658 --> 00:54:13,960
Oh, we got some work to do.

699
00:54:23,737 --> 00:54:25,036
Friends and colleagues...

700
00:54:25,038 --> 00:54:26,437
let's give a warm
Dreamland welcome

701
00:54:26,439 --> 00:54:27,806
to our new executive
vice president...

702
00:54:27,808 --> 00:54:28,775
Mr. Max Medici.

703
00:54:31,712 --> 00:54:33,812
Anything he needs,
anything at all...

704
00:54:33,814 --> 00:54:35,749
make it happen
as you always do.

705
00:54:40,553 --> 00:54:42,286
This is Miss Verna.

706
00:54:42,288 --> 00:54:43,654
She will handle
your schedule,

707
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:46,024
correspondence,
and all your calls.

708
00:54:46,026 --> 00:54:47,792
When you're needed
in meetings,

709
00:54:47,794 --> 00:54:49,393
she'll let you know.

710
00:54:49,395 --> 00:54:50,762
Are there meetings today?

711
00:54:50,764 --> 00:54:52,496
I'll let you know!

712
00:54:54,768 --> 00:54:56,633
Uh, Mr. Vandevere,
one question.

713
00:54:56,635 --> 00:54:58,839
Exactly what do I do?

714
00:55:03,043 --> 00:55:05,377
So where'd
Vandevere find you?

715
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,915
I was a street performer
in Paris.

716
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:11,916
He discovered me.

717
00:55:11,918 --> 00:55:13,719
And here I am.

718
00:55:15,888 --> 00:55:17,788
A millionaire's girlfriend.

719
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:18,992
That's a tough break.

720
00:55:20,726 --> 00:55:22,760
It's all for show.

721
00:55:22,762 --> 00:55:25,429
So you and he,
you're not, uh...

722
00:55:25,431 --> 00:55:27,098
I'm one of many
gems he wears

723
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,634
to reflect the light
back onto him.

724
00:55:29,902 --> 00:55:30,903
Huh.

725
00:55:32,638 --> 00:55:34,571
Good boy, Dumbo.

726
00:55:34,573 --> 00:55:36,373
- Good job.
- Yeah! They're gonna love him.

727
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:37,877
I think you are
the lucky one.

728
00:55:40,446 --> 00:55:42,012
- Well done, Dumbo.
- Good boy.

729
00:55:42,014 --> 00:55:45,351
Who's been dreaming
like I've been dreaming?

730
00:55:46,819 --> 00:55:49,386
So, how's everything?

731
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:51,088
- Good?
- Oh, we're making progress.

732
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:52,823
But he ain't
quite ready yet.

733
00:55:52,825 --> 00:55:55,592
What's the problem?
Doesn't the animal trust you?

734
00:55:55,594 --> 00:55:57,961
- It's not that simple.
- <i>Ma cherie...</i>

735
00:55:57,963 --> 00:56:01,665
we've already sold
all the tickets.

736
00:56:01,667 --> 00:56:03,467
Maybe our little
scientist here

737
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:05,337
can show us
that it's going to work.

738
00:56:18,017 --> 00:56:19,616
Prepare for takeoff.

739
00:56:19,618 --> 00:56:20,786
- Right wing?
- Check!

740
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:23,887
Left wing?

741
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:25,856
Check!

742
00:56:25,858 --> 00:56:27,960
Take her up, Dumbo.

743
00:56:31,864 --> 00:56:33,630
Let's go.

744
00:56:33,632 --> 00:56:35,100
- Come on, buddy. Come on.
- Come on, Dumbo.

745
00:56:37,069 --> 00:56:38,904
That's it. Come on.

746
00:56:45,577 --> 00:56:46,642
Let's try it again.

747
00:56:48,546 --> 00:56:50,381
You got this.
Here you go.

748
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:07,432
You beautiful
one-armed cowboy.

749
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,870
You've made me
a child again.

750
00:57:22,747 --> 00:57:25,781
<i>Welcome to the Colosseum...</i>

751
00:57:25,783 --> 00:57:28,553
<i>where the impossible
is possible.</i>

752
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:15,097
<i>Buonasera.</i> Max Medici.

753
00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:17,533
I discovered the elephant,
my elephant.

754
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:18,868
And basically I said no.

755
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,569
I walked out and that
was the end of that.

756
00:58:20,571 --> 00:58:21,904
The flying
elephant's mine.

757
00:58:21,906 --> 00:58:22,907
Yeah.

758
00:58:24,108 --> 00:58:25,942
You're the guy!

759
00:58:25,944 --> 00:58:28,744
You're the guy that's
made out of magic dust!

760
00:58:28,746 --> 00:58:29,979
Max.

761
00:58:29,981 --> 00:58:32,548
J. Griffin Remington.
Atlas Forge Bank.

762
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,850
He's the money man.

763
00:58:34,852 --> 00:58:36,118
The J?

764
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,955
Whoa! It's a pleasure
to meet you.

765
00:58:38,957 --> 00:58:40,756
How are you?

766
00:58:40,758 --> 00:58:42,091
You know, they say the moon
is made out of magic dust.

767
00:58:42,093 --> 00:58:43,693
That's why
they're going to send

768
00:58:43,695 --> 00:58:45,127
a man up there
one of these days.

769
00:58:45,129 --> 00:58:47,296
And my bank is
going to be the bank

770
00:58:47,298 --> 00:58:50,032
that finances
the expedition.

771
00:58:50,034 --> 00:58:51,167
What do you think of that?

772
00:58:51,169 --> 00:58:52,567
Uh-huh.

773
00:58:52,569 --> 00:58:53,903
Needless to say, Max...

774
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,771
we all have high hopes
for tonight.

775
00:58:55,773 --> 00:58:58,741
Oh, yeah. High hopes.
High hopes.

776
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,575
Well, you know,
hopes, and dreams,

777
00:59:00,577 --> 00:59:02,044
that's one thing.
That's words.

778
00:59:02,046 --> 00:59:04,213
But what we're talking
about here is facts!

779
00:59:04,215 --> 00:59:05,547
Plans!

780
00:59:05,549 --> 00:59:07,883
Plans! That takes
a lot of money.

781
00:59:07,885 --> 00:59:09,584
Which he hasn't got!

782
00:59:09,586 --> 00:59:11,187
So, we are hoping
that your pachyderm

783
00:59:11,189 --> 00:59:13,055
comes through
with the goods.

784
00:59:13,057 --> 00:59:15,958
Now let's get this show
on the road!

785
00:59:22,733 --> 00:59:24,135
We are looking good!

786
00:59:25,635 --> 00:59:27,336
Don't worry, Big D.

787
00:59:27,338 --> 00:59:29,105
There's just more room to fly out
there, that's all.

788
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:31,673
Round and round,
just like we practiced.

789
00:59:31,675 --> 00:59:34,076
And then Dad can talk
to Vandevere about the deal!

790
00:59:34,078 --> 00:59:35,144
About the what?

791
00:59:35,146 --> 00:59:36,678
We made a deal with Dumbo.

792
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,114
We promised we'd buy
his mom back

793
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,748
with all the money
he makes for the circus.

794
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:40,884
That's why he flies.

795
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,619
- Joe, not now!
- Are we ready?

796
00:59:44,621 --> 00:59:45,856
Yeah.

797
00:59:52,263 --> 00:59:53,828
Okay, let's go.

798
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:56,533
Okay, Dumbo, let's do this.

799
01:00:55,725 --> 01:00:57,392
Pink elephants?

800
01:00:57,394 --> 01:00:58,829
So?

801
01:01:57,953 --> 01:02:02,856
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls of all ages!</i>

802
01:02:02,858 --> 01:02:06,960
<i>This is the moment
we've all been waiting for!</i>

803
01:02:06,962 --> 01:02:09,096
<i>V.A. Vandevere,</i>

804
01:02:09,098 --> 01:02:11,299
<i>in association
with Max Medici...</i>

805
01:02:11,301 --> 01:02:15,969
<i>proudly presents,
making his Dreamland debut...</i>

806
01:02:15,971 --> 01:02:18,373
<i>You've seen a horse-fly.</i>

807
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:21,041
<i>You've seen a dragonfly.</i>

808
01:02:21,043 --> 01:02:23,977
<i>You've even seen a housefly.</i>

809
01:02:23,979 --> 01:02:26,146
<i>But you haven't
seen anything...</i>

810
01:02:26,148 --> 01:02:30,083
<i>until you see
an elephant fly.</i>

811
01:02:30,085 --> 01:02:33,053
<i>Let's get ready for Dumbo!</i>

812
01:02:50,272 --> 01:02:51,840
Coming through.

813
01:02:53,142 --> 01:02:54,843
Come on.

814
01:03:13,162 --> 01:03:14,263
He can do it.

815
01:03:16,899 --> 01:03:18,100
I know he can.

816
01:03:22,905 --> 01:03:24,938
<i>And here to welcome him...</i>

817
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:29,977
<i>our own Queen of the Heavens!</i>

818
01:04:20,995 --> 01:04:23,929
Dumbo.

819
01:04:23,931 --> 01:04:27,201
Five times around the ring.
That's all we have to do.

820
01:04:28,404 --> 01:04:29,837
Nice and easy,
like we practiced.

821
01:04:36,545 --> 01:04:38,210
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm.

822
01:04:38,212 --> 01:04:39,213
Why aren't they
putting up the nets?

823
01:04:42,383 --> 01:04:43,983
Hey, guys?

824
01:04:43,985 --> 01:04:45,318
Guys, what's going on?

825
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,520
Your men are supposed
to be out there!

826
01:04:46,522 --> 01:04:47,322
Change of plan.
From the top.

827
01:04:58,433 --> 01:05:01,133
I can't see the nets.

828
01:05:01,135 --> 01:05:03,504
- They're invisible.
- Hmm.

829
01:05:04,972 --> 01:05:06,574
What's wrong with you?
They need nets!

830
01:05:08,976 --> 01:05:09,909
Colette!

831
01:05:09,911 --> 01:05:11,412
Wait, don't take off!

832
01:05:13,214 --> 01:05:14,447
Dumbo...

833
01:05:14,449 --> 01:05:15,481
Oh, boy!

834
01:05:15,483 --> 01:05:17,151
...Prince of the Elephants.

835
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,956
I command you
to fly with me.

836
01:05:53,019 --> 01:05:54,186
Colette!

837
01:06:10,204 --> 01:06:11,604
Lower the platform!

838
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:31,992
Fly, little one!

839
01:06:51,478 --> 01:06:53,146
Magic dust!

840
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:22,242
Where's my show?

841
01:07:45,065 --> 01:07:47,732
The elephant's headed
to Nightmare Island.

842
01:08:07,687 --> 01:08:10,357
Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

843
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:47,792
Dumbo, it's okay.

844
01:08:47,794 --> 01:08:49,663
We're here.

845
01:08:50,697 --> 01:08:52,162
Good evening.

846
01:08:52,164 --> 01:08:53,631
It's Mr. Vandevere.

847
01:08:53,633 --> 01:08:54,832
- Hello, hi.
- Hey, that's V.A. Vandevere!

848
01:08:54,834 --> 01:08:56,166
Everyone having fun?

849
01:08:56,168 --> 01:08:57,535
Good.

850
01:08:57,537 --> 01:08:59,303
- Having a good time?
- Yes, sir.

851
01:08:59,305 --> 01:09:01,138
Fantastic.

852
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:03,608
Get him outta here.

853
01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:05,208
- Yes.
- Over here!

854
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:06,543
- Folks, please.
- Hello.

855
01:09:06,545 --> 01:09:08,345
Folks, I need you
to leave the exhibit.

856
01:09:08,347 --> 01:09:10,382
Come on.

857
01:09:12,318 --> 01:09:13,918
Guys, guys, go easy,
he's just a baby.

858
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,286
Soldier,
I give the orders here.

859
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:25,462
It's his bedtime.

860
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,733
<i>This attraction is now closed.</i>

861
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:38,508
Dad?

862
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:39,645
Uh-huh.

863
01:09:40,546 --> 01:09:42,281
It's Mrs. Jumbo.

864
01:09:48,187 --> 01:09:50,287
Come on,
I want to see Dumbo!

865
01:09:50,289 --> 01:09:51,755
I want to see Dumbo!

866
01:09:51,757 --> 01:09:52,689
I want my money back!

867
01:09:52,691 --> 01:09:53,857
I don't understand.

868
01:09:53,859 --> 01:09:56,293
The elephant flies.
You saw it.

869
01:09:56,295 --> 01:09:57,894
I saw a vanishing act.

870
01:09:57,896 --> 01:10:01,498
I'm not investing one cent
until I can see this works.

871
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,800
You can't control
your animal.

872
01:10:03,802 --> 01:10:05,936
You give me a little time,
I can fix this.

873
01:10:05,938 --> 01:10:09,441
Whatever! Till then,
the bank is closed.

874
01:10:13,912 --> 01:10:15,212
What happened up there?

875
01:10:15,214 --> 01:10:16,446
You lost control
of the animal.

876
01:10:16,448 --> 01:10:17,447
You're the animal.

877
01:10:17,449 --> 01:10:18,782
Where was my net?

878
01:10:18,784 --> 01:10:21,251
Nets are for rehearsal.
This is the show.

879
01:10:23,922 --> 01:10:26,323
Training?
You call that training?

880
01:10:26,325 --> 01:10:28,825
Now, hold on, Mr. Vandevere,
we know why he flew away.

881
01:10:28,827 --> 01:10:30,827
He recognized
that other elephant's call.

882
01:10:30,829 --> 01:10:32,929
The one on Nightmare Island.
It's his momma!

883
01:10:32,931 --> 01:10:34,698
It's true.
It's her.

884
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:35,999
She was sold from our
circus two months ago.

885
01:10:36,001 --> 01:10:37,534
Every child
knows its mother.

886
01:10:37,536 --> 01:10:40,003
And they say
elephants never forget.

887
01:10:40,005 --> 01:10:42,271
They can be
together now.

888
01:10:42,273 --> 01:10:43,974
Why are there children
in my office?

889
01:10:43,976 --> 01:10:47,911
Mr. Vandevere, please,
all Dumbo wants is his momma.

890
01:10:47,913 --> 01:10:49,311
Just reunite them,

891
01:10:49,313 --> 01:10:50,747
and he'll do
whatever you want.

892
01:10:50,749 --> 01:10:53,884
No, he'll do
whatever she wants.

893
01:10:53,886 --> 01:10:55,452
You think
I'd have bought her

894
01:10:55,454 --> 01:10:57,921
if I thought she was
related to him? Hmm?

895
01:10:57,923 --> 01:11:00,458
Doesn't help me at all.

896
01:11:04,897 --> 01:11:06,530
You wanna know
the most important thing

897
01:11:06,532 --> 01:11:07,866
about growing up?

898
01:11:09,534 --> 01:11:13,739
You've got to learn
to go it alone.

899
01:11:16,809 --> 01:11:19,442
Get rid of the mother.
You know where to take her.

900
01:11:19,444 --> 01:11:20,844
And treat yourself
to some new boots.

901
01:11:20,846 --> 01:11:23,214
But, sir,
you can't just kill her.

902
01:11:23,716 --> 01:11:24,881
Why not?

903
01:11:24,883 --> 01:11:26,348
Mr. Vandevere.

904
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:28,617
Wait!
Don't separate 'em, please.

905
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:30,653
Don't do that to my kids.

906
01:11:30,655 --> 01:11:33,023
You know, Holt,
when my father left us,

907
01:11:33,025 --> 01:11:34,657
it was a blessing really.

908
01:11:34,659 --> 01:11:37,660
Because I had to learn
how to fend for myself.

909
01:11:37,662 --> 01:11:40,063
Maybe that's what
your children need.

910
01:11:40,065 --> 01:11:41,564
Don't tell me
what my children need.

911
01:11:41,566 --> 01:11:43,001
Best take a step back,
Elephant Man.

912
01:11:45,336 --> 01:11:46,937
Darling...

913
01:11:46,939 --> 01:11:51,340
Dumbo and his mom
need a little alone time.

914
01:11:51,342 --> 01:11:53,609
So, Mommy's going to
take a little trip...

915
01:11:53,611 --> 01:11:55,680
so that Dumbo
won't be distracted.

916
01:11:58,449 --> 01:12:00,885
Milly! Milly!

917
01:12:13,898 --> 01:12:14,932
Colette?

918
01:12:16,734 --> 01:12:18,002
I have rehearsal.

919
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:20,738
Max.

920
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:27,576
<i>Nightmare Island.</i>

921
01:12:27,578 --> 01:12:29,378
Milly?

922
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:31,013
<i>Home of the most dangerous
beasts in the world.</i>

923
01:12:31,015 --> 01:12:32,683
Sir, park's closing.

924
01:12:39,824 --> 01:12:40,925
Milly!

925
01:12:44,929 --> 01:12:45,930
Milly!

926
01:12:50,835 --> 01:12:52,870
Did you find her?

927
01:12:53,671 --> 01:12:54,672
No.

928
01:12:57,942 --> 01:13:01,777
Well, her momma always knew
what to say. No matter what.

929
01:13:01,779 --> 01:13:03,946
She always knew.

930
01:13:03,948 --> 01:13:07,516
Your children don't need you
to be perfect.

931
01:13:07,518 --> 01:13:09,720
They just need you
to believe in them.

932
01:13:11,388 --> 01:13:12,857
That simple, huh?

933
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:22,399
All right, well,
I'm gonna keep looking.

934
01:13:43,553 --> 01:13:46,188
That's my daughter
all right.

935
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:49,359
The only girl I know who
runs away to go to school.

936
01:13:50,527 --> 01:13:52,161
It's our fault.

937
01:13:52,163 --> 01:13:54,662
Bet Dumbo wishes
he never met us.

938
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:57,199
Ah, you showed him
he could fly.

939
01:13:57,201 --> 01:14:00,035
You think
he'd ever trade that?

940
01:14:00,037 --> 01:14:02,039
He would to have
his mom back.

941
01:14:07,677 --> 01:14:08,979
I miss Momma.

942
01:14:10,881 --> 01:14:12,616
Yeah, so do I.

943
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:19,687
There's something
I want to show you.

944
01:14:19,689 --> 01:14:20,922
<i>With advances in both</i>

945
01:14:20,924 --> 01:14:22,824
<i>engineering and medicine...</i>

946
01:14:22,826 --> 01:14:25,227
<i>the human and the mechanical
will soon be combined...</i>

947
01:14:25,229 --> 01:14:28,696
<i>to assist ordinary families,
workers and veterans.</i>

948
01:14:28,698 --> 01:14:30,832
<i>All kinds
of technological marvels</i>

949
01:14:30,834 --> 01:14:32,903
<i>await us in the 20th century.</i>

950
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:36,506
You're gonna do
great things.

951
01:14:37,741 --> 01:14:38,742
I know it.

952
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:51,019
Whoa, whoa. What's this?

953
01:14:51,021 --> 01:14:52,654
Oh, give me a break.

954
01:14:52,656 --> 01:14:55,525
I gotta teach you
how to read English, too?

955
01:15:00,697 --> 01:15:03,698
Oh, Max, hello!

956
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,767
Good, you brought
the paperwork.

957
01:15:05,769 --> 01:15:07,735
Max...

958
01:15:07,737 --> 01:15:10,538
I was reviewing
your troupe...

959
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,240
and to be honest with you...

960
01:15:12,242 --> 01:15:14,909
they're really pale imitations
from the acts we already have.

961
01:15:14,911 --> 01:15:16,778
So I was thinking,
I don't know,

962
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:18,579
a month's severance?
Seems fair.

963
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:19,883
<i>Capisce?</i>

964
01:15:21,251 --> 01:15:23,151
I thought you promised to...

965
01:15:23,153 --> 01:15:26,054
Max, the contract says
that I'd hire them.

966
01:15:26,056 --> 01:15:28,089
It never stipulated
for how long.

967
01:15:28,091 --> 01:15:31,192
So, get your little band of
low-rent freaks out of here.

968
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:34,762
But they're my troupe.
They're countin' on me.

969
01:15:34,764 --> 01:15:37,231
Okay, let's have a heart.

970
01:15:37,233 --> 01:15:39,102
Why don't you tell them?

971
01:15:50,814 --> 01:15:54,084
'Bout time, boss.
So, when do we start?

972
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:06,860
What's going on, guys?

973
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:08,829
Vandevere's fired them all.

974
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,967
They're to leave by tomorrow.

975
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:26,680
Goodbye, little friend.

976
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:28,151
Goodbye.

977
01:16:30,353 --> 01:16:33,221
We wanted to see him
one last time.

978
01:16:33,223 --> 01:16:36,890
One last time
to see him fly.

979
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:39,227
I don't think
he wants to anymore.

980
01:16:39,229 --> 01:16:41,161
Oh, no. But he must.

981
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:43,930
He cannot lose
Mrs. Jumbo again!

982
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:46,769
Uh, I'm afraid
it's rather worse than that.

983
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:49,036
Mr. Sotheby?

984
01:16:49,038 --> 01:16:51,972
I've come
to clear my conscience.

985
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:54,775
I resigned my position as soon
as I heard him give the order.

986
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:57,144
What order?

987
01:16:57,146 --> 01:17:00,213
Mrs. Jumbo will be gone
by tomorrow night.

988
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:02,051
And she's not
meant to survive.

989
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:20,400
This "Dreamland"
doesn't deserve him.

990
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:22,237
No circus does.

991
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:38,653
Well, who's gonna be
willing to help me?

992
01:17:40,956 --> 01:17:42,791
Set Dumbo
and his momma free.

993
01:18:12,121 --> 01:18:13,686
<i>Welcome to the Colosseum,</i>

994
01:18:13,688 --> 01:18:16,391
<i>where the impossible
is possible.</i>

995
01:18:18,759 --> 01:18:21,428
Okay.
Second time's the charm.

996
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:24,997
Let's see if Dream Daddy's
worked out the kinks.

997
01:18:24,999 --> 01:18:26,366
<i>Here to pick up the elephant</i>

998
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:28,168
- <i>from Nightmare Island?</i>
- Confirmed.

999
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:29,804
Unlock the back gates.

1000
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:55,428
Dumbo in position!

1001
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:57,263
Soon as he flies,
you run back to his tent

1002
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:58,864
and I'll find you there.

1003
01:18:58,866 --> 01:19:00,199
All right, Big D.

1004
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:04,336
It's all up to you now.

1005
01:19:04,338 --> 01:19:06,772
Come on, Holt!

1006
01:19:16,751 --> 01:19:18,119
To hell with it.

1007
01:19:22,823 --> 01:19:24,890
Ready for positions.

1008
01:19:24,892 --> 01:19:27,159
We could have used
a little rehearsal.

1009
01:19:27,161 --> 01:19:28,827
Rehearsal?

1010
01:19:28,829 --> 01:19:31,132
Think we got a rehearsal
at the Battle of the Argonne?

1011
01:19:32,166 --> 01:19:34,066
You sure you can do this?

1012
01:19:34,068 --> 01:19:35,903
I fly elephants
all the time.

1013
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:39,538
Are you sure
you can do this?

1014
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:41,409
With one hand
tied behind my back.

1015
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:56,824
Wait. What's that?

1016
01:19:58,192 --> 01:19:59,193
Ma'am?

1017
01:20:00,995 --> 01:20:02,995
Ma'am?

1018
01:20:02,997 --> 01:20:05,064
Sorry, ma'am,
attraction's closed.

1019
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:08,300
My dream...
to be a mermaid...

1020
01:20:08,302 --> 01:20:10,835
and now
they've taken it away.

1021
01:20:10,837 --> 01:20:13,305
And yet I hear
the water singing.

1022
01:20:13,307 --> 01:20:14,540
I hear them
beckoning me home.

1023
01:20:14,542 --> 01:20:16,475
Lady, just be careful,
okay?

1024
01:20:16,477 --> 01:20:17,875
Return me
to the vast abyss!

1025
01:20:17,877 --> 01:20:19,311
Let's go.

1026
01:20:19,313 --> 01:20:21,748
- My destiny, the sea!
- Okay.

1027
01:21:11,131 --> 01:21:12,398
We've lost power!

1028
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,931
Even the cages?

1029
01:21:13,933 --> 01:21:17,135
But the animals...

1030
01:21:17,137 --> 01:21:19,471
Find the breakers.
Get the lights back on!

1031
01:21:19,473 --> 01:21:21,308
And make sure
those cages are locked.

1032
01:21:39,926 --> 01:21:41,326
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1033
01:21:41,328 --> 01:21:43,328
<i>boys and girls.</i>

1034
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:46,998
<i>Making his second
Dreamland debut.</i>

1035
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,668
<i>Let's get ready for Dumbo!</i>

1036
01:22:49,696 --> 01:22:50,563
Hey!

1037
01:22:59,204 --> 01:23:00,939
It's a trick!
Get back to the...

1038
01:23:16,255 --> 01:23:20,758
<i>And once again, our very own
Queen of the Heavens!</i>

1039
01:23:42,649 --> 01:23:43,714
You.

1040
01:23:43,716 --> 01:23:46,552
Where is
your circus of freaks?

1041
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:49,787
What's going on?

1042
01:23:49,789 --> 01:23:52,289
The elephant's
mother is gone!

1043
01:23:52,291 --> 01:23:55,225
His troupe's behind it!

1044
01:23:55,227 --> 01:23:57,762
Alert the tower
and secure the gates.

1045
01:23:57,764 --> 01:23:59,364
Don't let them get out.

1046
01:24:00,632 --> 01:24:02,735
But why would they
only take the one?

1047
01:24:04,236 --> 01:24:07,270
Keep your eye on Farrier
and those kids.

1048
01:24:07,272 --> 01:24:08,974
You! Come with us.

1049
01:24:23,155 --> 01:24:24,456
There they are!

1050
01:24:26,492 --> 01:24:27,559
Hey!

1051
01:24:37,503 --> 01:24:39,135
Hey, you!

1052
01:24:39,137 --> 01:24:40,604
What are you
doing up there?

1053
01:24:40,606 --> 01:24:42,405
That's private property.

1054
01:24:42,407 --> 01:24:44,307
Come on! Get down here!

1055
01:24:44,309 --> 01:24:45,542
Now!

1056
01:24:45,544 --> 01:24:48,745
Hey, I'm Max Medici,
Vandevere's partner.

1057
01:24:48,747 --> 01:24:51,314
He's just a maintenance man
fixing a light!

1058
01:24:51,316 --> 01:24:52,616
Get back to your posts!

1059
01:24:52,618 --> 01:24:54,486
Yes, sir, Mr. Medici.

1060
01:25:09,468 --> 01:25:11,468
Let's try this again.

1061
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:12,771
You and me.

1062
01:25:28,453 --> 01:25:29,719
Hey, the kids?

1063
01:25:29,721 --> 01:25:30,887
Where are the kids?

1064
01:25:30,889 --> 01:25:32,321
Hey, have you
seen the kids?

1065
01:25:32,323 --> 01:25:36,425
Dumbo,
Prince of the Elephants!

1066
01:25:36,427 --> 01:25:39,430
I command you
to fly with me.

1067
01:25:54,545 --> 01:25:56,782
Dumbo, please fly.

1068
01:25:57,849 --> 01:25:59,550
Do it for your momma.

1069
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:55,740
Where's your father?

1070
01:27:09,253 --> 01:27:10,788
Dumbo!

1071
01:27:23,367 --> 01:27:25,168
Hey! Get those kids!

1072
01:27:28,304 --> 01:27:29,907
Dumbo!

1073
01:28:02,405 --> 01:28:03,540
Come on.

1074
01:28:04,709 --> 01:28:05,841
There!

1075
01:28:23,426 --> 01:28:24,494
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

1076
01:28:26,796 --> 01:28:28,331
Just passing through!

1077
01:28:29,666 --> 01:28:31,301
Hey! You can't do that!

1078
01:28:34,604 --> 01:28:35,737
Get the elephant!

1079
01:28:35,739 --> 01:28:37,538
You get the elephant!

1080
01:28:58,828 --> 01:29:01,996
Don't worry.
Dad'll be here soon.

1081
01:29:01,998 --> 01:29:03,566
Where's the elephant?

1082
01:29:09,939 --> 01:29:11,706
Why are you
just standing there?

1083
01:29:11,708 --> 01:29:13,007
Get to the tower!

1084
01:29:13,009 --> 01:29:15,343
Electricity's failing!
There's no elevators!

1085
01:29:15,345 --> 01:29:18,980
When I last checked,
they invented stairs.

1086
01:29:18,982 --> 01:29:20,681
<i>We seem to be experiencing</i>

1087
01:29:20,683 --> 01:29:22,619
<i>some technical difficulties.</i>

1088
01:29:37,066 --> 01:29:39,634
What happened to my power?

1089
01:29:39,636 --> 01:29:42,470
What power, <i>mon cheri?</i>

1090
01:29:42,472 --> 01:29:43,971
You ungrateful...

1091
01:29:43,973 --> 01:29:47,842
You were nothing before
I made you my... Uh...

1092
01:29:47,844 --> 01:29:50,880
I believe the word
is "queen."

1093
01:29:52,381 --> 01:29:53,783
I need lights!

1094
01:29:56,786 --> 01:29:58,619
Mr. Vandevere, wait!

1095
01:29:58,621 --> 01:30:00,554
We have to reset the mains,
or you could cause a surge!

1096
01:30:00,556 --> 01:30:01,756
Right now it's impossible!

1097
01:30:01,758 --> 01:30:04,060
Nothing's impossible!

1098
01:30:05,695 --> 01:30:07,563
Mr. Vandevere!

1099
01:30:13,468 --> 01:30:14,838
Mr. Vandevere, stop!

1100
01:30:40,596 --> 01:30:42,131
Milly! Joe!

1101
01:30:50,939 --> 01:30:52,774
Come on. Go!
Come on!

1102
01:31:19,468 --> 01:31:20,901
Get everyone out!

1103
01:31:20,903 --> 01:31:22,938
Evacuate the park!

1104
01:31:26,975 --> 01:31:28,708
Milly! Joe!

1105
01:31:41,857 --> 01:31:43,025
Hey!

1106
01:31:48,997 --> 01:31:51,031
Where is the elephant?

1107
01:31:51,033 --> 01:31:53,033
Let her go!

1108
01:32:09,818 --> 01:32:10,984
Come on!

1109
01:32:10,986 --> 01:32:12,218
Milly! Joe!

1110
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:13,987
Dad!

1111
01:32:13,989 --> 01:32:15,255
- You all right? All right?
- We're fine.

1112
01:32:15,257 --> 01:32:16,957
Okay, come on.
All right, cover your faces.

1113
01:32:16,959 --> 01:32:18,692
Give me your hand!
Come on!

1114
01:32:18,694 --> 01:32:19,828
Back!

1115
01:32:22,130 --> 01:32:23,231
Stay close.

1116
01:32:32,707 --> 01:32:34,007
Come on, everybody.

1117
01:32:34,009 --> 01:32:36,709
Let's get to the seaport!
Now!

1118
01:32:36,711 --> 01:32:38,779
- Where are the Farriers?
- They must still be inside.

1119
01:33:11,645 --> 01:33:12,546
Dad!

1120
01:33:13,248 --> 01:33:14,713
It's okay, Joe.

1121
01:33:16,218 --> 01:33:17,285
Come here. Come here.

1122
01:33:20,222 --> 01:33:21,189
Dumbo!

1123
01:33:29,264 --> 01:33:30,330
Dumbo!

1124
01:33:30,332 --> 01:33:32,298
Come on!

1125
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:35,167
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Jump!

1126
01:33:35,169 --> 01:33:36,735
Come on. Come on.

1127
01:33:44,311 --> 01:33:46,113
- All right, let's go.
- Stay close, come on.

1128
01:33:49,083 --> 01:33:50,349
Okay. Go! Go! Go!

1129
01:33:50,351 --> 01:33:52,751
Come on!

1130
01:33:52,753 --> 01:33:54,920
- Dumbo!
- Come on!

1131
01:33:54,922 --> 01:33:56,321
Dumbo! What's wrong?

1132
01:33:56,323 --> 01:33:58,157
Guys! Milly! Joe!
Come on!

1133
01:33:58,159 --> 01:33:59,794
Dumbo, let's go!

1134
01:34:03,798 --> 01:34:04,897
Go!

1135
01:34:10,004 --> 01:34:11,637
Dumbo!

1136
01:34:11,639 --> 01:34:13,272
Get him!

1137
01:34:13,274 --> 01:34:15,808
He's seen us.
Dumbo, you gotta go.

1138
01:34:15,810 --> 01:34:17,242
They're comin' for you.
You gotta go, Dumbo.

1139
01:34:17,244 --> 01:34:18,343
He lost the feather.

1140
01:34:18,345 --> 01:34:19,812
Feather doesn't do nothin'.

1141
01:34:19,814 --> 01:34:21,780
Dumbo, you don't need
the feather to fly.

1142
01:34:21,782 --> 01:34:23,348
Dad, they're coming!

1143
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:25,717
Stand back! Stand back!

1144
01:34:25,719 --> 01:34:26,754
Out of my way!

1145
01:34:28,989 --> 01:34:31,056
Dumbo, remember this?

1146
01:34:31,058 --> 01:34:33,058
From my momma?

1147
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:37,930
I can unlock any door.
And you can, too.

1148
01:34:37,932 --> 01:34:39,697
But I don't need
this key to do it.

1149
01:34:39,699 --> 01:34:40,935
And you don't need
the feather.

1150
01:34:42,136 --> 01:34:43,137
Come on.

1151
01:34:58,419 --> 01:34:59,684
Dad!

1152
01:34:59,686 --> 01:35:00,787
Gotta go. Come on!

1153
01:35:02,722 --> 01:35:04,123
What are you doing?

1154
01:35:04,125 --> 01:35:05,857
There ain't room
for the three of us.

1155
01:35:05,859 --> 01:35:07,226
You get him to the seaport
and I'll see you there.

1156
01:35:07,228 --> 01:35:08,628
Go on, Big D.

1157
01:35:14,901 --> 01:35:16,101
Grab 'em!

1158
01:35:16,103 --> 01:35:17,103
Hey!

1159
01:35:23,244 --> 01:35:25,246
Hey!

1160
01:35:26,913 --> 01:35:28,948
That's my elephant!

1161
01:35:42,729 --> 01:35:44,295
They're safe.

1162
01:35:44,297 --> 01:35:45,899
Come on, let's go!

1163
01:35:48,768 --> 01:35:50,268
Hey! Get back here!

1164
01:35:53,507 --> 01:35:55,306
You freak!
What have you done?

1165
01:35:55,308 --> 01:35:57,141
What they pay me for,
mister.

1166
01:35:57,143 --> 01:35:58,743
Put on a hell of a show.

1167
01:36:01,981 --> 01:36:03,848
Hey! Him!

1168
01:36:03,850 --> 01:36:05,750
Right there, arrest that man.
He stole my elephant.

1169
01:36:05,752 --> 01:36:08,085
Hey, we had a contract,
Medici!

1170
01:36:08,087 --> 01:36:11,124
I'm no expert, but I think
you got bigger problems here.

1171
01:36:23,036 --> 01:36:25,138
Wow. This is a disaster.

1172
01:36:26,306 --> 01:36:27,939
Come on,
I'll buy you a hot dog.

1173
01:36:27,941 --> 01:36:29,874
Sounds good, J.G.

1174
01:37:09,449 --> 01:37:11,982
Last call for cargo!

1175
01:37:11,984 --> 01:37:14,585
All aboard!

1176
01:37:35,841 --> 01:37:37,109
Colette!

1177
01:37:45,183 --> 01:37:46,883
Where's your father?

1178
01:37:46,885 --> 01:37:49,052
Don't worry.
He'll be here.

1179
01:37:55,227 --> 01:37:56,594
Dad!

1180
01:37:56,596 --> 01:37:58,464
I knew you could ride.

1181
01:38:04,870 --> 01:38:06,972
- Pramesh, we have to go.
- Please, hurry.

1182
01:38:08,273 --> 01:38:10,809
Hurry! Come on! Hurry!

1183
01:38:11,910 --> 01:38:13,045
Come.

1184
01:38:13,945 --> 01:38:15,414
Let's go home.

1185
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:33,365
Hey!

1186
01:38:55,253 --> 01:38:57,289
Well, get out of here,
you little troublemaker.

1187
01:39:00,025 --> 01:39:01,057
Go on.

1188
01:39:41,132 --> 01:39:43,031
Ladies and gentlemen...

1189
01:39:43,033 --> 01:39:47,704
introducing our world-famous
flying elephant.

1190
01:39:55,079 --> 01:39:58,448
Welcome to
the Medici Family circus!

1191
01:39:58,450 --> 01:40:00,683
Where we believe
no wild animals

1192
01:40:00,685 --> 01:40:03,287
shall be held in captivity.

1193
01:40:10,695 --> 01:40:12,595
See Rongo...

1194

the world's strongest
and most versatile man.

1195
01:40:18,068 --> 01:40:21,336
Meet the bewitching
Miss Atlantis...

1196
01:40:21,338 --> 01:40:24,072
now performing
underwater Shakespeare,

1197
01:40:24,074 --> 01:40:28,377
with the world's
only living merman, Puck!

1198
01:40:33,718 --> 01:40:36,084
And visit
our newest attraction,

1199
01:40:36,086 --> 01:40:38,620
Milly Farrier's
World of Wonders...

1200
01:40:38,622 --> 01:40:42,224

Marvel at the skills

01:41:07,084 --> 01:41:10,319
our cowboy of the future!

1204
01:41:24,802 --> 01:41:28,237
And the Pearl of Paris,
Colette.

1205
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:30,508
Queen of the Heavens!

1206
01:41:54,865 --> 01:41:58,700
Friends, young and old,
you have a home at our circus.

01:42:02,506 --> 01:42:04,173
Believe me, they do.
